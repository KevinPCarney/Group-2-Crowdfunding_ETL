# Group-2-Crowdfunding_ETL
ETL Project Summary

**Overview**
This project involved extracting data from two Excel files, transforming it using Python libraries, and loading it into a relational database. The goal was to apply our ETL skills by creating a clear relational diagram, establishing appropriate data types, and defining primary and foreign keys for optimal database structure. The team consisted of three members collaborating to execute and deliver the project successfully.

**Process**
Extraction: Data was extracted from two separate Excel files containing relevant datasets.

Transformation: Python libraries such as pandas were utilized to clean, manipulate, and prepare the data for database insertion. This included standardizing formats, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

Loading: The transformed data was loaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS) using Python. This step involved creating tables based on a relational diagram, defining appropriate data types, and establishing primary and foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity and optimize querying.

Visualization: Visualizations were generated using matplotlib and seaborn to provide insights into the data. Charts, graphs, and statistical summaries were used to highlight key trends, patterns, and anomalies within the datasets.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
Python: Pandas for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
Database:  PostgreSQL.
Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

**Team Collaboration**
This project was a collaborative effort involving three team members. Each member contributed to different stages of the ETL process, including data extraction, transformation, loading, and visualization. Regular communication and coordination were key to ensuring the projectâ€™s success and timely delivery.

**Insights**
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in handling real-world data, applying ETL processes effectively, and deriving meaningful insights through data visualization. The project underscored the importance of teamwork and interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving project objectives and delivering high-quality results.
